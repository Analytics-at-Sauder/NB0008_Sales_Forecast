    "This is the first of a series of two notebooks, where we forecast sales for a retailers with 45 stores, each contains several departments, in multiple regions. We also want to understand the extent to which external factors, including holidays and promotions, affect sales in different departments, stores, and regions. In this notebook, we are going to focus on the exploration and manipulation of our data, whereas the next one would be centered around modeling itself. Understanding the data is important for analytics, and we recommend you to read both notebooks in order to gain a better grasp of analytics for big and messy data. The three datasets that we are using are already included (see the \"Data\" folder) in the repository where this Jupyter notebook is located, but you can also find them on [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset?select=sales+data-set.csv). \n",

    "One of the most commonly used time series forecasting model are ARIMA models, which is what we are going to use in this notebook. However, there are also other models that you could use, such as ETS Models. At the same time, since we want to understand the relationships between sales and several other variables, including mark downs, holidays, and potentially weather (temperature), it would be benefitial for us to build a Simple or Multiple Linear Regression Model first, with sales as the response variable. Then we can build time series models to forecast the explanatory variables, such as temperature, and plug in the time-series predicted explantory variables into the SLR/MLR models to generate further forecasts for the response variable,sales. Models generated in this manner might be less accurate as we are going through multiple steps, each adding more risks for errors; however, time series models combined with explanatory models are more interpretable and provide you with more managerial insights that could help you make recommendations and decisions. Let's go ahead and import the libraries we need and load our data:"

    "4. From the first 10 rows, we can see that the dates do match up; however, it wouldn't hurt to check the proportion of matching records (by date and store) especially if we are thinking about merging together the two dataframes\n",
